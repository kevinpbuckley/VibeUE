# Asset Management Tests

These tests verify searching, duplicating, opening, saving, and deleting assets. Run sequentially.

---

## Setup Assets

Create a basic actor blueprint for testing asset operations. Put it in the Blueprints folder and call it AssetSearchTest.

---

Also make a widget blueprint in the same location called AssetWidgetTest.

---

## Searching for Assets

I'm looking for any widgets that have "radar" in the name.

---

Are there any textures with "background" in the name?

---

Show me all the blueprints in the project.

---

What widgets exist in the UI folder?

---

Let me see some engine content too - search with engine assets included.

---

Just show me the first 10 results for textures.

---

## Duplicating Assets

I want to make a copy of the AssetSearchTest blueprint. Name it AssetSearchTestBackup.

---

Copy the widget test too. Call the duplicate AssetWidgetTestBackup.

---

Search for "Backup" to make sure those copies exist.

---

## Opening and Saving

Open the AssetSearchTest blueprint in the editor.

---

Open the widget test too.

---

Save any unsaved assets without asking me.

---

## Asset References

What references the movement input action? Show me where IA_Move is used.

---

Does anything reference the AssetSearchTest blueprint?
