# Quick Smoke Test

Run through these prompts sequentially to verify basic functionality. Assets will be created in MCP_Test folder.

---

## Getting Started

I need a basic actor blueprint for testing. Put it in the MCP_Test folder and call it QuickTest.

---

Also create a UI widget in the same folder called QuickTestWidget.

---

## Basic Blueprint Operations

Add a float variable called Health to the QuickTest blueprint.

---

Create a function in QuickTest called Calculate.

---

My blueprint needs a spotlight. Add one.

---

## Function Logic

I need a damage calculator function. It should take base damage as input, multiply it by a random value, and output the final damage.

---

Make sure that compiles.

---

## Character Blueprint

Create a playable character blueprint in MCP_Test. Call it PlayerTest.

---

Give the player health variables - both max health and current health as floats.

---

Add a spotlight to the player called PlayerLight and make it bright, like 5000 intensity.

---

Add a function for taking damage.

---

Compile the player blueprint.

---

## Menu Widget

Create a menu widget in MCP_Test called MenuTest.

---

It needs a dark background image.

---

Add a vertical container for the menu buttons.

---

Put a Play button in there with some text.

---

And a Quit button with text too.

---

## Verification

Search for all the stuff we made in MCP_Test.

---

## Cleanup

Delete everything in MCP_Test. Force delete without asking for confirmation - just clean it all up.
