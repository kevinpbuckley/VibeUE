# Blueprint Lifecycle Tests

Tests for creating, configuring, compiling, and reparenting blueprints. Run sequentially.

---

## Creating Blueprints

I need a basic actor blueprint. Put it in the Blueprints folder and call it TestActor.

---

Also make a character blueprint called TestCharacter.

---

## Blueprint Information

Show me everything about the TestActor blueprint.

---

Is replication enabled on TestActor?

---

## Configuring Properties

Turn on replication for TestActor.

---

Compile it.

---

Now show me the info again to verify replication is on.

---

## Reparenting

What class does TestCharacter inherit from?

---

Change it to inherit from Pawn instead of Character.

---

Compile after the reparent.

---

Show me TestCharacter's info to confirm the parent changed.

---

## Event Graph Analysis

What custom events are in TestActor?

---

Give me a summary of the event graph. Keep it under 200 nodes.

---

Try a shorter summary with just 50 nodes max.

---

## More Configuration

Set the initial lifespan on TestActor.

---

Read back the properties to verify.

---

## Compilation

Recompile TestActor.

---

Check the state to make sure it compiled cleanly.
