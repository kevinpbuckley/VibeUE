# Blueprint Function Tests

Tests for creating functions, parameters, and local variables. Run sequentially.

---

## Setup

Create an actor blueprint called FunctionTest in the Blueprints folder.

---

## Creating Functions

What functions does FunctionTest have?

---

Add a function called CalculateHealth.

---

Tell me about that function.

---

Show me the function list again.

---

## Working with Parameters

What parameters does CalculateHealth have?

---

It needs a float input called BaseHealth.

---

Add another float input called Modifier.

---

And I need a float output called ResultHealth.

---

Show me all the parameters now.

---

Actually, change BaseHealth to an integer instead of float.

---

Remove the Modifier parameter, I don't need it anymore.

---

Verify the parameter changes.

---

## Local Variables

What local variables are in CalculateHealth?

---

Add a float local called TempResult for intermediate calculations.

---

Add another float local called Multiplier.

---

Show me the locals.

---

Change TempResult to an integer.

---

Remove Multiplier.

---

Verify the locals are correct now.

---

## Function Properties

Make CalculateHealth a pure function with no side effects.

---

Put it in the Combat Health category for organization.

---

Let me call this function from the editor too.

---

Show me the function info to verify all that.

---

## Different Parameter Types

Make a new function called TypeTest for experimenting with types.

---

Add parameters of different types - integer, float, boolean, and string.

---

Add a name type parameter too.

---

I need an actor object reference as a parameter.

---

And a vector struct parameter.

---

List all those parameters.
